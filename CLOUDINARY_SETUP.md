## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `src/config/cloudinary.ts` - Configuration file
- `src/data/projects.ts` - Cloudinary integration functions
- `src/components/Projects.tsx` - Gallery component with Cloudinary support
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added Cloudinary-related types

### How It Works:
1. **Automatic Detection**: Website checks if Cloudinary is configured

3. **Real-time Updates**: New images appear automatically
4. **Optimized Delivery**: Images are automatically optimized for web

### Activation Process:
```typescript
// In src/config/cloudinary.ts
export const CLOUDINARY_CONFIG = {
